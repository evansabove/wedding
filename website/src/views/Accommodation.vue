        We have exclusive use of
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bakewellretreats.com/haddongrove"
          >Haddon Grove Farm Cottages</a
        >
        for Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. The cottages range from one to
        five bedrooms sleeping 49 guests across the whole site, and each contain
        a kitchen, bathrooms and communal areas. There are also outdoor BBQs, a
        games room, a playground and a swimming pool (so pack your costume!). We
        would love to have you to stay!
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of our hire, we've paid for all the rooms upfront. The rooms owe
        us about £40 per person per night, so a contribution around this figure
        would be great. Get in touch if you're interested, we'd really love to
        have you! 👍
